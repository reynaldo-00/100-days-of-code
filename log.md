# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Aug 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** 
Learned how to replicate a glitch effect using plain css.   
Combination of two tutorials
1. [CSS Glitch Effect](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/12/21/css-glitch-effect/)
2. [CSS Glitch Hover Effects - Html CSS Image Hover Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HijzmwZzk)

**Stublink Work**
1. Changed Chat file structure and export statements for cleaner import statements
2. Implemented loading earlier messages on ChatPage component

**Thoughts** Using the filter and clip-path css tags are very new to me definitly see huge benefits in fully learning them for use in later front end designs

### Day 02: Aug 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress:**
1. Further increased understanding of Node.js and MogoDB authentication using Bcrypt and JWT passport strategys following advanced React.js udemy course
2. Designed a Dating App Profile Card as a part of DailyUI

**Thoughts:** 
Still need to spend more time going over JWT and passport before getting a full grasp of it.
Feeling more confident with CSS/Sass design production speed has increased
