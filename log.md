**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Aug 9th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to replicate a glitch effect using plain css.   
Combination of two tutorials
1. [CSS Glitch Effect](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/12/21/css-glitch-effect/)
2. [CSS Glitch Hover Effects - Html CSS Image Hover Effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2HijzmwZzk)

**Thoughts** Using the filter and clip-path css tags are very new to me definitly see huge benefits in fully learning them for use in later front end designs
